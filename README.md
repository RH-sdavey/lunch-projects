# lunch-projects

A lot fo time when learning a new language, I feel its important to have project idea to work on. 
There are many benefits to "building something" because there is problems you have to solve, subjects to search for etc.

My go to project idea if I cant think of anything else to build is a lunch scraper of all local menus around the office I currently work in.

Ive so far done this in windows powershell, chrome extension and python. There will be others in future. ( cool idea is work in progress )

### Lunch scraper. 
 Python
 should just work by clicking lunch_scraper.pyw
 
### chrome-obed. 
Google chrome extension. Instructions how to install to chrome are shown on the sub-README.

### TODO 
add others
